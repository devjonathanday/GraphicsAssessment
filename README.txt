3D Game Engine Demo
-------------------
This program is a demonstration of multiple aspects of a modern 3D game engine, including:
• Skeletal animation with animation blending
• Particle systems, with environment interaction
• 2D GUI which can be interacted with by the user, and interacts with the 3D world
• Custom materials applied to 3D objects, featuring normal and occlusion maps
• Shaders applied to custom materials, written in HLSL

The player can click on the various UI elements placed at the top of the scene, as well as controlling their player character with the WASD keys.
